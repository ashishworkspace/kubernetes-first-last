Request and Limits
------------------


Request is used by scheduler for scheduling the pod
A pod can use resouces greater than what is mention inside request i.e. CPU limit as well as Memory Limtit
 
A pod get terminated if pod use resources > what is mention inside limits
It will than reschedule on same node or other nodes

Using the concept of Limits inside the Pod it can be categories into 3 type of Qos(Quality of Service):
  1. Guaranteed ( request and limits are equal)
  2. Brustable  (request and limits not equal)
  3. Best Effort (neither limit not request is mention)


During Pod evition i.e. Pod get removed from node automatically due to high load on node or failure of nodes
Pod with Qos class Best Effort will be removed first than Brustable and after that Guaranteed will be removed.
