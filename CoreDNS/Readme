CoreDNS
-------

Kubernetes use coredns for configuration of DNS inside the Pod

`kubectl get svc -n kube-system`
the above command will return a service that has some ip,
which is the ip of DNS server.


Every pod launched inside the k8s cluster must have this DNS server ip inside path 
/etc/resolv.conf 

Every pod that launch inside the k8s cluster automatically becomes DNS client of the server running inside kube-system namespace


---- 
So what is the use DNS server ?
=> DNS server forms the database for the service and map that service with the ip of that service.
